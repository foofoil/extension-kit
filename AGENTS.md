# Agent Instructions for extension-kit

## Project Overview

extension-kit is the reusable Extension API for first-party foofoil extensions. It is a Swift package, not an app.

It owns Extension API v1 contracts: the versioned C ABI, Manifest schema, capability identifiers, `ContentRequest` / `ContentSession` value types, navigator and media snapshots, compatibility fixtures, and contract tests.

Host loading, installation, the Extension Registry client, and UI belong in `foofoil`. Capability implementations such as Hi-Fi belong in their own repositories. Do not move those concerns into this package.

The long-term binary boundary is the C ABI (`foofoil_extension_create`) and JSON value messages. Swift protocols, SwiftUI views, `NSView`, and in-process objects are not part of the public Extension API.

## Core Principles

1. **Keep the kit small.** Add only contracts, schema, fixtures, and tests that extensions and the host actually share.
2. **Prefer Apple frameworks.** Use Foundation and existing value types. Do not add a third-party dependency unless native APIs cannot meet the requirement.
3. **Preserve ABI and decoding compatibility.** Existing hosts and extensions must continue to load. New Codable fields must decode as optional with sensible defaults. C function-table fields may only be appended; callers must check struct size and function pointers.
4. **Prefer incremental change.** Reuse existing types and validators. Keep diffs focused.

## Architecture

- Put the C header and its compilation unit in `FoofoilExtensionABI`. Put Swift contracts and validators in `FoofoilExtensionKit`.
- Keep types `public` with `public` initializers when they are part of the package API.
- Capability identifiers and contract versions are stable names. Do not rename them to match a single extension domain.
- `min` / `max` Extension API ranges are valid only when every version in between is compatible.
- Do not add host-only types (loaders, installers, registry clients, SwiftUI views) here.
- Preserve existing documentation comments. Add concise Chinese comments for ABI, negotiation, or decoding rules that are not self-evident. Do not comment obvious code.

## Dependencies and Assets

- This package is distributed under the MIT License. New code and assets must be distributable under that license.
- The default decision for a new third-party dependency is **no**.
- Do not commit `.build/`, DerivedData, test artifacts, or machine-specific project state.

## Testing and Verification

- Add or update focused tests for Manifest validation, request/session encoding, capability negotiation, navigator and media contracts, and ABI layout.
- Use the Swift Testing framework under `Tests/FoofoilExtensionKitTests`.
- Run before considering a change complete:

  ```sh
  swift test
  ```

- Treat new warnings as defects. Do not silence warnings without addressing or documenting the underlying reason.

## Change Discipline

- Inspect surrounding types, schema, and fixtures before editing so they stay consistent.
- When creating a file with a `Created by` header, use the human identity returned by `git config user.name`. Never use an agent, model, assistant, or tool name.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in the working tree.
- Do not raise the package's minimum macOS version or change product/module names unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not add analytics, telemetry, remote processing, or network services.

## Git Commit Guidelines

- Write commit messages in English.
- Follow Conventional Commits and keep the subject concise, for example: `feat: add media playback snapshot fields`.
- Keep each commit focused on one coherent change and do not include generated or unrelated files.
